1) Difference between null and undefined
  Null means no value. Undefined means variable declared but no value assigned

2) map() – Transforms an array and returns a new array.
   forEach() – Iterates over an array but does not return anything.

3) == : Compares values only
  === : Compares value + type

4) handle asynchronous operations into synchronous code. Make easy to read and handle errors.

5) Scope determines where a variable can be accessed.
   Global Scope – Accessible anywhere.
   Function Scope – Variables declared inside a function are only accessible inside that function.
   Block Scope – Variables declared with let or const inside {} are only accessible inside the block.
